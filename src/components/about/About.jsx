        I am a professional in social work, with 5 years of experience working in complex and changing contexts, in which I developed communication and teamwork skills that allow me to contribute to the achievement of objectives and the construction of productive work environments.<br/>
          Currently, through the Master's Degree in Digital Didactics, I build learning experiences for digital literacy of people who are in a situation of economic vulnerability and social marginalization. My knowledge in web application development allows me to generate solutions that effectively integrate technology, education and social sciences.
